Database for storing liquor and creating mixed drinks

The webpage starts with a display of a liquor tab and a mixed tab.
The liquore tab is made up of various liquor list and the mixed drink contains a mixture of drinks and some pictures by the side.

You can search for a drink in the database.
If the drink does not exist then you make the drink. However, what you make is restricted to what liqour is in the database.

If a user decides to make mix a drink, for example Gin and Vodka, they will have to know the parts(amount) of drinks to be used.

When the parts for a mix drink is selected, the information goes to concotion. The direction to mix the parts are given. 

Upon completion of the direction, a new page is created  that shows the mixture that is newly created and an image of what is created.
